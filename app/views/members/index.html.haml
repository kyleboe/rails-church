  %h1 DHH's Prayer 🙏
  %p Our DHH who art in Spain,
  %p Hallowed be thy name.
  %p Thy framework come.
  %p Thy will be done
  %p on Rails as it is in #{link_to 'Basecamp', 'https://basecamp.com/'}.
  %p Give us this day our daily code,
  %p and forgive us our monkeypatches,
  %p as we forgive those who flame us on twitter,
  %p and lead us not into elixir,
  %p but deliver us from phoenix.
  %p For thine is the model,
  %p and the view, and the controller,
  %p for ever and ever
  %p rails new
